# MP3 DOM
The task is to create a webpage that conveniently displays the songs and playlists in a player object. 

## New Requirements!
- There is now a section for adding new songs to the player. Make it work!
- Add a play button to every song. Clicking it will play that song.
- Add a remove button to every song. Clicking it will remove the song from the playlist.
- There should be only one event listener on the entire songs list, that handles all play and remove events of songs.
- You are given new template files to use: `index.new.html` and `index.new.js`.

## Bonus Requirements
-   After a song begins to play, it automatically switches to the next one when the song duration has passed.
-   The color of the durations of songs should reflect their length. A duration of less than 2 min will show green, and will be gradually redder until it is completely red for durations that are above 7 min.
-   When a song is removed, all playlists in the page will also be updated.
-   When adding a new song, the songs list will remain sorted by title.
-   Anything else you can think of...
